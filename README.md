# Coding Sample_1 - Shiny App - Automated ELISA data processing

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> PURPOSE OF THE SHINY APPLICATION:</font>
<p>     Example of Shiny app automating research (ELISA) data munging ( non-proprietary source data ).
<p>     Purpose: App allows sharing of a script to clean up common research data (ELISA reader output).
<p>       App saves time for research scientists, who no longer have do manually clean up
<p>       their data through error prone copying & pasting. Cleaned data can be downloaded in 
<p>       'tidy' format, i.e. suitable for Tableau or SQL database. Data are also plotted for 
<p>       quick review and QC of the data. 
</pre>

<font color="3300CC"> INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:</font>
<p>     Step 1) Download all files (click the green "Code" button above; download .zip folder)
<p>     Step 2) Extract the zip folder contents 
<p>     Step 3) Open the Shiny app.
<p>     Step 4) Use the app to upload the example ELISA data, and review the output plots. 
<p>     Step 5) Download the cleaned data for experiment-tailored processing/plotting in Tableau/Spotfire.

# Coding Sample_2 - FACS Analysis & Discussion

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> PURPOSE OF THE CODE:</font>
<p>     Example of R analysis using FACS data ( non-proprietary source data ), 
<p>     including munging, plotting, and analysis narrative.
</pre>

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:</font>
<p>     Step 1) Download all files (click the green "Code" button above; download .zip folder)
<p>     Step 2) Extract the zip folder contents
<p>     Step 3) Run the .Rmd file
<p>     Step 4) Use the "Preview" button in R Studio to view the html report output
</pre>


# Coding Sample_3 - Derivation of a prognostic signature in renal cell carcinoma transcriptomic data (from GDC/TCGA)

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> PURPOSE OF THE CODE:</font>
<p>     Analysis provides an example of of data exploration, differential expression analysis (Voom/Limma),
<p>     and survival analysis ( taken from the GDC public database )
</pre>

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:</font>
<p>     Step 1) Download all files (click the green "Code" button above; download .zip folder)
<p>     Step 2) Extract the zip folder contents
<p>     Step 3) Optional: Input a local directory where you want the GDC files saved (default download uses be "api" method. Files total 156MB).
<p>     Step 4) Run the .Rmd file using 'knit' OR just look at the included .nb file to view analysis. 
</pre>



# Coding Sample_4 - FASTER FACS - Automated processing of FlowJo statistics

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> PURPOSE OF THE CODE:</font>
<p>     Shiny app processes FlowJo stats & experimental metadata using a two-step upload & download.
<p>     Non-proprietary demo data are included. 
</pre>

<pre>
<font color="3300CC"> INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:</font>
<p>     Step 1) Download all files (click the green "Code" button above; download .zip folder)
<p>     Step 2) Extract the zip folder contents
<p>     Step 3) Install both R & R Studio
<p>     Step 4) Open the "app_FASTER FACS.R" file in R Studio & then click the "Run App" button. 
<p>             The first time the app is run, it will automatically install required R packages. 
<p>             Package installation may take a few minutes, but it will only happen once.
